    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">[I will advise my potential client to take the most secure methods that are available to protect his/her website againts potential treats, but ofcourse it will be depending on the project and the budget the customer is willing to put into project. The customer should decide themselves on how they will manage their website. With that I will give the customer the standards information first on how to secure passwords like password manager, two-factor authorization etc, advise them to not share the login with anyone who has nothing to do with the website, educated the team about potential security problems, for example scanning for security vulnerabilities for possible security threat in web applications and find SQL Injection, XSS, Server Side-Request Forgery, Directory Traversal, and others, plus web server configuration issues. It is very important for the client to perform security exercises and include everyone in security practices. Advise the customer to use CI/CD TOOLS. The very best way is to advice the client to hire expert in this matter if they do not have a security team or expert of their own. ]</p>
